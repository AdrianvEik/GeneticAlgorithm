Population
##########

The population of the genetic algorithm is defined by an 2 dimensional array
of individuals. Each individual is represented by a 1 dimensional array of
genes. The number of genes in each individual is defined by the number of
variables in the problem. The number of individuals in the population is
defined by the population size. The population size is a parameter of the
algorithm. The population size is the number of individuals in the population
at any given time.

Population initialisation methods
---------------------------------

Below are the library provided population initialisation methods. These
methods are used to initialise the population of the genetic algorithm.
